I'm Kaushalya, Welcome to my GitHub!

Bit about me :D

Quench to know wide array of topics, but unluckily be pragmatic and prioritise since we only have limited time on this earth. Wanting to leave world better than I found it, so I could rejoice when I die.
- Solve problems with code, help out projects that I love.
- Build stuff for fun and profit!
-
- I have my preferences for tech stacks, but I do not mind others, if it is fair trade off. Not tech wars please time is limited!
- Front-end :
	- HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, React may be Solid in future.
- Back-end : Go (poof!), Want to learn Rust
- Want someone else computer Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Hetzner
- Databases : PostgreSQL may be Redis,
	- want to scale might try ScyllaDB
- Mobile : Kotlin KMM, do not want to write same thing twice, UI is fine though.
-
- I write to understand topic better, teach somethings others do not know. So I have said at least danke to other great writers I read from.

I do some rambling here, but somethings may be gems.
